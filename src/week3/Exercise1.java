/*Consider a class that models a simple (non-scientific) calculator that deals only with integers. 
 * Discuss with your colleagues what methods and variables this class might have. 
 * Then write a Java class that would implement it.
	One possible implementation is:
	Variable total
	Method add, subtract, multiply, divide, clear total, print total
